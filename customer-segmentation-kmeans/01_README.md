# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project applies K-Means clustering to a synthetic customer dataset in order to segment customers based on behavioral and demographic features. The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Elbow method for selecting optimal number of clusters
- Cluster visualization with meaningful labels

## Features
- ðŸ“Š Visualizes customer segments in 2D PCA space
- ðŸ“Ž Includes elbow plot for optimal `k` selection
- ðŸ§  Applies unsupervised learning with `sklearn`

## Files Included
- `customer_data.csv`: The input dataset used
- `enhanced_elbow_plot.png`: Shows the elbow method results
- `enhanced_cluster_plot_v2.png`: Visualizes customer segments by cluster

## How to Run
```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
python customer_segmentation.py
```

## Example Use Cases
- Marketing campaign targeting
- Customer behavior analysis
- Persona development for business strategy
